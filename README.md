# SAS_CaseStudy

This program uses SAS to read and analyze TSAClaims2002_2017.csv file then generates report. 

This file was created from publicly available data from the TSA and the Federal Aviation Administration, or FAA. 
The TSA data has information about claims and the FAA data has information about USA airport facilities. 
The case study data was created by concatenating individual TSA airport claims data, removing some extra columns, and then 
joining the concatenated TSA claims data with the FAA airport facilities data. 
The TSA Claims 2002 to 2017 CSV file has 14 columns and over 220,000 rows
